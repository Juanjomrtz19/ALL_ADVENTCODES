#My coded solutions of the differents daily challenge Adventcode 2023
##DAY 1
For this day 1 the solution is 56049  
My idea is to use a function that turn a string into an array then I go though the array and when it finds the first numeric caracter  
it breaks the loop.  
After that I create a new array that is the reverse array of the first one and I do the same thing.
With two numbers I have the two values I need to combine then and return that number.  
Finally, I add all that numbers.
